        Youre the best person kishu. Youre like a fucking present from god himself. Youre like one of god's angels. <br><br>I really miss u and the school days. You're a really good girlfriend uk.
        You're perfect just the way you are my love. <br><br>You're the prettiest person to ever exist. I am so in love with you i even skip my gym and games just for you. <br><br>
        Ill learn how to cook for you. Ill learn how to do all the household chores for you. Youre beautiful. <br><br> I say this everytime because i really mean it, every inch of your skin is beautiful.
        Youre just too beautiful for me to handle and not tell u or brag about it. <br><br> I promise ill keep u safe from all those dirty bullshit men out there, youll be safe in my presence.
        <br><br> I want to give you the best, warm, comfortable and a loving life ahead. Youre the only reason im studying.<br><br> Because honestly i dont care about myself when im with you
        because i know im gonna be fine with u. <br><br> Youre my number one priority, you come before every fucking thing. Youre just too precious to me. I cant afford to lose such a person.<br><br>
        If i could i would hug u and give you tons of kisses but since i cant do that, im doing this for you. I hope you like it. And since ur home now i cant write more i need to give this to you.
         <br><br><br>
        I'm sorry for all the times i hurt you. I never mean to hurt you I just want the best for you always.<br><br>
        You're safe with me. Im gonna keep u warm and safe.<br><br><br><br> I love you the most my angel. You mean the world to me darling.
